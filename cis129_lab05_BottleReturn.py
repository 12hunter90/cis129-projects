# Program tells you how many bottles you
# have collected in a week and how much you have earned for collection

# Declare variables below

# Loop to run program again

    # Collect bottles returned for 7 days
    while counter <= 7:  
        todayBottles = int(input(f"Enter number of bottles returned for day #{counter}: "))
        totalBottles += todayBottles

    # Code to calculate total payout
    PAYOUT_PER_BOTTLE = 0.10
    totalPayout = totalBottles * PAYOUT_PER_BOTTLE

    # Code to print the number of total bottles and total payout
